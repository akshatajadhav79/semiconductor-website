		<h2>N-type semiconductor</h2>

				<li>Mainly due to electrons</li>

			<p>When a pure semiconductor (Silicon or Germanium) is doped by pentavalent impurity (P, As, Sb, Bi) then, four electrons out of five valence electrons bonds with the four electrons of Ge or Si.

The fifth electron of the dopant is set free. Thus, the impurity atom donates a free electron for conduction in the lattice and is called “Donar“.

Since the number of free electron increases by the addition of an impurity, the negative charge carriers increase. Hence, it is called n-type semiconductor.

Crystal as a whole is neutral, but the donor atom becomes an immobile positive ion. As conduction is due to a large number of free electrons, the electrons in the n-type semiconductor are the MAJORITY CARRIERS and holes are the MINORITY CARRIERS.</p>
