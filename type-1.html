		<h1>Intrinsic semiconductor</h1>

		Conduction Mechanism in Case of Intrinsic Semiconductors
			<ol type="a">
				<li> In absence of electric field </li>
				<li> In presence of electric Field</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Germanium (Ge) and Silicon (Si) are the most common type of intrinsic semiconductor elements. They have four valence electrons (tetravalent). They are bound to the atom by covalent bond at absolute zero temperature.

When the temperature rises, due to collisions, few electrons are unbounded and become free to move through the lattice, thus creating an absence in its original position (hole). These free electrons and holes contribute to the conduction of electricity in the semiconductor. The negative and positive charge carriers are equal in number.

The thermal energy is capable of ionizing a few atoms in the lattice, and hence their conductivity is less.</p>
			<h2>The Lattice of Pure Silicon Semiconductor at Different Tempertures</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>At absolute zero kelvin temperature:</li>
					<article>At this temperature, the covalent bonds are very strong and there are no free electrons and the semiconductor behaves as a perfect insulator.</article>
					<li>Above absolute temperature:</li>
					<article>With the increase in temperature few valence electrons jump into the conduction band and hence it behaves like a poor conductor.</article>
				</ul>

			<p>In intrinsic semiconductors, current flows due to the motion of free electrons as well as holes. The total current is the sum of the electron current I<sub>e</sub> due to thermally generated electrons and the hole current I<sub>h</sub></p>
				Total Current(I)=I<sub>e</sub>+I<sub>h</sub>
				<p>For an intrinsic semiconductor, at finite temperature, the probability of electrons to exist in conduction band decreases exponentially with increasing bandgap (Eg)</p>
