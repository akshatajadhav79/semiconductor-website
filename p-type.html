				<li>Mainly due to electrons</li>
				<li>Entirely neutral</li>

			<p>When a pure semiconductor is doped with a trivalent impurity (B, Al, In, Ga ) then, the three valence electrons of the impurity bonds with three of the four valence electrons of the semiconductor.

This leaves an absence of electron (hole) in the impurity. These impurity atoms which are ready to accept bonded electrons are called “Acceptors“.

With the increase in the number of impurities, holes (the positive charge carriers) are increased. Hence, it is called p-type semiconductor.

Crystal as a whole is neutral, but the acceptors become an immobile negative ion. As conduction is due to a large number of holes, the holes in the p-type semiconductor are MAJORITY CARRIERS and electrons are MINORITY CARRIERS.</p>
